# Contributing
Contributions are **welcome**!

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/axlon/laravel-postal-code-validation).

## Guidelines
- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to
install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up to
date.
- **Add tests** - Any significant change in the codebase should include tests.
- **Create feature branches** - Pull requests from your master branch won't be accepted.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), randomly breaking public APIs
is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, create multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make
multiple intermediate commits while developing, please
[squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before
submitting.
